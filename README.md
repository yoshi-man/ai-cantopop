# AI Cantopop - Generating Cantopop Lyrics with GRU RNN Models


## Project Brief

Cantopop has been a huge part of the Hong Kong cultural since the 1960's, and of all the different subgenres within cantopop, there's always bound to be a love element to it. Whether it's singing about reminiscing love, being lonely after breaking up, you name it. It's been such a way for so long that melodies and lyrics are instantly recognizable, and lyrics can be sort of predicted a few lines ahead. Imagine what a trained model can do!


## What You'll Find Here

Here I will include more in-depth explanations of how exactly I did each step, and what kinds of decisions were made in designing the process. Do note that the approach for this project was to get to the result as fast as possible, more of a "maximise the result with the least effort" kind of approach. So it's far from perfect, and there's a ton that can be improved for the pipeline or simply just the code.
